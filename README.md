My start of making a HTML5 game!

- Les 1: The basics of drawing on <canvas>
- Les 2: Gravity, friction and the 'Player' object
- Les 3: A moving background
- Les 4: Collision detection and the 'Enemy' object (see lesson 6 for now)
- Les 5: Graphics and audio (work in progress)
- Les 6: A complete roundup of a working HTML5 game. This is still a work in progress but you can see a demo on http://kelvinteractive.nl/flappybier/
